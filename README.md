This is the companion website to the paper **An Experiment to Compare Combinatorial Testing
in the Presence of Invalid Values** by Konrad FÃ¶gen and Horst Lichter. It is submitted to the 7th International Workshop on Quantitative Approaches to Software Quality [(QuASoQ-2019)](http://quasoq2019.swc-rwth.de/) and currently in review.

- *src/main/java/de/rwth/swc/quasoq2019* contains source code which implements the experiments
- *src/main/java/de/rwth/swc/quasoq2019/runner* contains source code which implements executable components that log experiment generations and extract metrics from the logs
- *data/arrays* contains the test suites used in the experiment. They are obtained from from [NIST Covering Array Tables](https://math.nist.gov/coveringarrays/)
- *data/evaluations/* contains the raw data sets of the paper in CSV format and summaries in spreadsheet format.
